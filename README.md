### Environments 
* Linux, with clang, or gcc

### Build
* A mixed of Makefiles and CMAKE, my cmake skills are not yet good enough. 

### Why did I had So Pain when I dealt with CPP? 

* I am not using Linux. 
* I am not aware of the complexity of building and compiling a CPP programs, which is a big part of programming in CPP. 
* I am not good at testing and debugging. 
* I am not good with Macros and Pre-processors too. 

### What Noobs from Python or Java should be aware when learning CPP? 

* CPP it's totally different and it's really dumb comparing to java and python. 
* CPP place big importance on building the system via header files, include directory, macros, and linkage. 
* CPP won't tell you what exactly is wrong, beause if it blows up, it's down to the binary level, and OS/(cpp runtime) won't be able to provide satisfying answers on the errors.
